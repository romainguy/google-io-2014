Material Witness
================

A Google I/O 2014 demo written by Romain Guy [http://www.curious-creature.org](http://www.curious-creature.org)

Material Witness is a sample application for the new Material Design APIs introduced in the Android L Preview SDK:

* Custom theme colors
* Dynamic palette
* Circular reveal
* Activity transitions

And a few other things such as colored status and navigation bars, path tracing, etc.

The complete video of the Google I/O 2014 talk detailing how this application works can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97SWYiRtF0Y&feature=youtu.be).
